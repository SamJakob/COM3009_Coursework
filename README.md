# COM3009 (Computer Security) â€” Accompanying Code
- Java Version: 17 (Amazon Corretto 17.0.x.x)
- Original Host OS: macOS 13.x.x

The cipher texts have not been supplied and the paths have been redacted.
Please update `ASSETS_DIRECTORY` (RSACracker, line 26)
(VigenereCracker, line 14) to reflect the path with the source files
(e.g., `english.txt` if the code is to be run.)

This code base is initialized as a Gradle project, but Gradle is not used
in any capacity other than as a build system.

Given the correct set of classes in the class path, this should run under
any build system.

Please refer to [`build.gradle`](./build.gradle) for the file that will
be built by Gradle by default (i.e., the main class).

All code is my own, and may be assumed to be under MIT License.
